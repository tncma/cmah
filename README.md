OneCMA 
=======
by CMAH Team. Application created for CMA Hackathon.

OneCMA is an application where all the systems governed by CMA are integrated. The objective of the application is computerizing the various applications/departments of CMA, wherever applicable/possible. Also, the existing software applications will be integrated with OneCMA. So, there will NOT be separate software applications specific to a department. This way, the productivity, security and public satisfaction can be improved. Communication between the inter modules/departments would be easy since the data is going to be available in cloud.
